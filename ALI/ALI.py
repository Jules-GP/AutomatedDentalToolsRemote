"""ALI - Automatic Landmark Identification, computed on the tool server.

Replaces the former local module (a Slicer widget driving the ALI_CBCT and
ALI_IOS CLIs, a conda `shapeaxi` environment and a WSL detour on Windows).
Nothing is computed in Slicer any more: the panel is generated from the
server's `GET /tools` entry, the data goes up, the landmarks come back. The
old CLI modules are left in the tree but are no longer wired to this one.

Three things about ALI's schema are worth knowing when reading this file:

* **There is no `mode` argument.** The server inspects what the input actually
  holds - volumes, DICOM series or surface meshes - and picks the CBCT or IOS
  engine itself. This module must not guess: a `.zip` can carry either kind,
  so an extension tells you nothing.
* **Both engines' selections are always shown, and one of them is always
  inert.** The engine isn't known until the server has looked at the data, so
  there is no field to hide the other one behind - `visible_when` needs a
  `choice` argument to test, and ALI declares none on purpose. What the schema
  does instead is put each engine's selection in its own collapsible box
  (`section`) and repeat "CBCT only" / "IOS only" in each description, which
  formgen renders as a visible hint. Hiding one by guessing would be wrong more
  often than the clutter is annoying.
* **CBCT landmarks can be chosen by region or one by one.** `cbct_regions` is
  the granularity a human wants; `landmarks` (119 options, rendered as tabs
  from the server's own grouping) is for asking for named points, and naming
  any of them *replaces* the region selection rather than narrowing it. It
  exists because ASO's fully-automated mode registers on seven landmarks that
  straddle two regions, and going through regions would run 58 deep-RL agents
  to use seven.
* **A partial run is normal and is not an error.** A landmark whose weights
  are missing from the bundle, or whose agent never converged, is reported in
  `run_report.json` while every other landmark is still written out. Surfacing
  that report is this module's one real job - see handleResult.
