"""VISU -- look at what a tool produced, one case at a time.

Every other module in this extension asks the server to compute something.
This one computes nothing: it opens folders that are already on disk and puts
them on screen in the order a reader wants them, with the arrow keys to step
from one patient to the next.

**Why it is not "drag the folder into Slicer".** Dragging works and tells you
nothing about which file goes with which. A cohort of forty comes back as a
scan here, a mask two directories down under a name the tool invented, and a
landmark file whose stem matches nothing -- and the one arrangement that is
wrong renders exactly as well as the right one. `VISULib.index` decides the
pairing; this file is the panel over it.

**The one thing it must never do is lie about the frame.** ASO's landmarks
carry its recentring and its ICP rotation, so they belong to the scan ASO
WROTE; ALI writes no scan at all, so its landmarks belong to the one the
caller sent. Draw either on the other and the picture renders without an error
and is wrong by a rotation -- which is precisely the mistake a reviewer opened
this panel to catch. So a view names the scan its overlays are drawn on, and
says whether that was read off the folder or assumed.

# names at one bundle. That list is not too long by accident: it is every
# tool's REGRESSION FIXTURE, and most of it is a second timepoint, a transform
# or a spreadsheet that a viewer has nothing to do with. Size does not separate
# them either: 13 entries sit under 250 MB and 9 under 100.
#
# The rule a sample has to pass: AT LEAST THREE subjects, each one carrying
# both a scan and the landmarks placed on it. Three because the arrows are the
# point and two of anything demonstrates nothing; matched because the panel
# exists to show what belongs to one scan together, and a subject that comes
# up bare teaches the reader that the panel lost something.
#
# Counted with this module's own index against the bundles on disk. **Exactly
# one hosted folder passes.** Four carry landmarks at all and the other three
# hold one or two subjects -- the server's test data is each tool's regression
# fixture, assembled to prove a tool still runs rather than to be looked at.
# A folder of one's own is where a richer set lives; `VISULib.index` walks any
# directory, so pointing the field at it needs nothing from here.
# Each entry is (tool, the server's own name, what to call it here). The third
# is not decoration: the server's names are each tool's fixture names --
# `IOSCBCT_RegTestFiles`, `CBCT_SemiAuto_DCM` -- and they say which REGRESSION

        This is the whole of what VISU learns about the thing that opened it.
        It is handed a directory and a callable; it does not know there is a
        run, a server, or a step that stopped -- and it must not, or the next
        caller with a folder and a question has to be added to it.

        `on_continue` is what puts the Continue button on the panel. A reader
        who opened VISU themselves passes none and sees none, because they
        have nothing to hand back to.

        `beside` is `[(label, folder)]` to index WITH this one and not review:
        the scans the caller sent. A pause hands back what a step produced and
        never its inputs, so without them a result has nothing to be drawn
        against -- ALI's landmarks have no scan at all, and a registered scan
        has nothing to be compared to. The first label is taken as the
        acquisition, which is what `index` falls back to for an overlay with
        no anchor of its own.

        `registered` says the caller declared what it produced to be in the
        acquisition's frame, which puts the two scans in ONE view. VISU does
        not decide that and could not: see `index.BASIS_REGISTERED`.

        `{"slot", "tool", "kind"}`, or None when there is nowhere to go --
        which is the ordinary case and is why it defaults to none. VISU still

        `VISULib.review` already versioned its file for -- must be one key
