"""
Automated Standardized Orientation (ASO) of cone-beam computed tomography scans
(CBCT) and intraoral surface scans (IOS).

Thin GUI over the remote `ASO` tool. Orientation runs on the server, so nothing
is installed into Slicer's interpreter, no conda environment is created and no
reference bundle is downloaded to this machine.

Replaces the former local module, which drove the PRE/SEMI_ASO_CBCT and
PRE/SEMI_ASO_IOS CLIs from inside Slicer. `ASO_Method/` and
`Resources/UI/ASO.ui` are left in the tree but are no longer wired to this one.

    lives in ServerToolsCoreLib. See ARCHITECTURE.md.

    Nothing about the anatomy lives here: the landmark catalog, the tooth chart,
    which options start checked, and whether a run is CBCT or IOS, semi- or
    fully-automated, are all arguments in the server's schema rendered by
    formgen - so a landmark added server-side appears in this panel with no
    client release.

    Nor does the *layout*, which is the part that used to force a hand-written
    panel. The four collapsible boxes, the landmark tabs, the tooth chart and
    the fact that a CBCT run is never asked about teeth all come from the
    schema's presentation hints (`section`, `visible_when`, `ui`, `groups` - 
    see ARCHITECTURE.md). The old local module spent a four-page
    QStackedWidget and ~700 lines of checkbox plumbing on the same result, with
    the tooth numbering written out twice inside the widget.

    In particular the mode is *asked for*, never guessed: a `.zip` can hold CBCT
    volumes or intraoral meshes, so no extension could tell this module which
    pipeline the user wanted.
