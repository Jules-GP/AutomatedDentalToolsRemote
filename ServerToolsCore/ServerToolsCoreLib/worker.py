"""Off-UI-thread execution so a slow tool call never freezes Slicer.

Hard constraint: never touch the MRML scene from a secondary thread. BackgroundJob
runs `target` on a worker thread; the outcome (or exception) is pushed onto a
queue.Queue and drained by a qt.QTimer on the main thread, which then invokes
on_success/on_error/on_progress. Everything touching slicer.* therefore stays

# Slicer's embedded interpreter keeps the GIL on the main thread while that
# thread waits inside Qt's event loop, so a Python worker thread barely runs at
# all. Measured in Slicer: a bytecode loop managing 13,079,723 iterations per
# second on the main thread manages 6,632 on a worker while the main thread is
# idle in Qt -- and a 94 MB test file that downloads in under a second from a
# script took twenty seconds from a panel. The 100 ms drain timer below is not
# enough on its own: it lifts the worker to 453,957, still twenty-nine times
# short.
#
# `time.sleep` releases the GIL for its duration, so a timer whose callback
# does nothing but sleep hands the main thread's idle time to the worker. The
# same loop then measures 15,586,975 iterations per second, i.e. the transfer
# runs at full speed. What it costs is that a UI event can wait up to
# _YIELD_SECONDS for the main thread, which is a fraction of one frame.
