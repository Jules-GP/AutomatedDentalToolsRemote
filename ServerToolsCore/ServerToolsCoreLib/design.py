# Corner radii, and they are tokens for the same reason the spacings are: with
# the outlines gone it is the SHAPE of a fill that says what kind of thing

RADIUS_LG = 6    # a card: a section, an input row, a table

# **A hairline says where a thing is.** Every control a clinician operates is a
# white surface with a one-pixel edge round it, on a grey ground -- the classic
# instrument look, and the one that survived being compared against four others
# on a real panel. It is not the fashionable answer: a borderless treatment,
# where a control is a tinted slot sunk into its card, was built and rejected
# for reading as washed out on the screens this actually runs on.
#
# The rules that fall out of it, and that every factory here keeps:
#
#   * ONE border width, 1px, in every state. Only the COLOUR moves -- a
#     hairline that thickened on focus would grow its field by a pixel under
#     the pointer, and Qt lays a row out from the border box.
#   * Small radii. A 12px corner on a 1px line reads as a bubble; 4px reads as
#     a cut edge, which is what an instrument does.
#   * The accent is spent on ONE thing at a time: what is focused, or what is
#     chosen. Everything else is the edge and the two neutrals.
#
# BACKGROUND is the panel's ground, SURFACE everything raised on it -- a
# section, a control, the table behind a catalogue. They are ONE colour here,
# which is the whole point of an outlined design: the line does the separating,
# so the fills do not have to.

# stylesheet, and on this Slicer Qt that draws **nothing at all** -- no arrow,
# no tick, and not a line in the log. It is the failure mode a data URI always
# has here: the sheet parses, the rule applies, the image is simply never
# resolved, so the only symptom is a light blue square at the end of a combo
# box with no arrow in it.
#
# So they are written to real `.svg` files under the application's temporary
# directory and referenced by path, which Qt has always resolved. The file is
# named after a digest of its own contents, so a changed shape or a changed
# colour is a different file and a stale one is never picked up; and a write
# that fails answers "" and the rule is left out entirely, which falls back to
# the platform's own arrow rather than to nothing.

#   * bars WITHOUT their percentage. The exact figure is written underneath in
