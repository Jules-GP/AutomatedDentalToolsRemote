"""Moving big files over one connection is what made a 100 MB scan take minutes.

A single HTTP request rides a single TCP connection, and a single TCP
connection to a remote server is bound by its congestion window long before it
is bound by anyone's bandwidth: on a link with a 100 ms round trip, one stream
plateaus around a tenth of what the line can actually carry. Adding streams is
what fixes that, and nothing else does -- the wire is not full, the window is.

So a file goes up as independent parts sent over several connections at once
(`upload_file`) and a result comes down as several byte ranges pulled at once
(`download_ranged`). Both talk to the endpoints in the server's transfer.py.

Three things fall out of the same design, and they matter as much as the speed:

- **A failure costs one part, not the file.** A dropped connection at 95% used
  to mean starting again from zero. Now the part is retried, and a whole pass
  of failures re-reads what the server is still missing rather than guessing.
- **Progress is real.** The old upload was one opaque `requests.post` that
  reported nothing until the server answered; here every part that lands moves
  a counter, so the panel can show bytes, rate and a time left.
- **Integrity is checked per part.** Each part carries its SHA-256 and the
  server refuses to write one that does not match. The parts tile the file
  exactly, so the whole thing is verified without either side making a second
  pass over it -- which for medical imaging is the point: a silently truncated
  CBCT is a wrong result, not an error.

Imports neither `slicer` nor `qt` (see ARCHITECTURE.md dependency rule), so it
is testable in plain CI with `requests` mocked out.
