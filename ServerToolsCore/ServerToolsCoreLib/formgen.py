"""Builds Qt widgets from a server tool's argument schema, and reads them back.

Imports neither `requests` nor anything HTTP — see ARCHITECTURE.md dependency
rule. The server is the single source of truth for the schema: adding a field
to a tool server-side makes it appear here without touching any module code.

File-type arguments (any type accepted by `is_file_type` — "file", "zip_file",
"nifti_file", ...) are skipped by build()/collect(): they are not generic
scalar fields, they get their own row in base_widget's "Inputs" section. The
*widget* for such an input is still built here (`file_widget`), so that every
"schema shape -> Qt widget" decision lives in one file.

So is the translation from the server's vocabulary to the one base_widget acts
on — `file_input_modes`, `auto_file_mode`, `result_kind_for` — for the same
reason: it is all "what does the schema say this panel should be". A module
then declares only what the schema *cannot* say (see file_input_modes).

Some schema types render as several widgets rather than one, so they get a
small Python holder class each (`MultiChoiceGroup`, `FileOrFolderInput`,
`JoystickInput`) instead of a QWidget subclass: PythonQt makes subclassing
awkward, and everything the rest of this module needs fits in a plain object
exposing `container` for layout. The one genuine QWidget subclass, the
joystick pad itself, lives in joystick.py.

Escape hatch: a hand-written .ui can still be used by giving its widgets a Qt
dynamic property named "serverArgName" matching the schema argument name —
collect() will pick them up as if they had been generated. Not used by
SurgMovPred; documented for future modules that need custom layout.

    of writing into them (a drag sets both at once) while the boxes remain
    for typing an exact number, the same pairing FlexReg keeps between its
    pads and line edits. Change notification hangs off the boxes alone, so
    every input path (drag, wheel, keys, typing) is one code path.

    A `spring_back` pad is relative: the knob deals out displacements from its
    rest position and the boxes accumulate them (clamped by their own ranges),
    the running total becoming the new base when the gesture ends. Without it
    the pad is absolute and simply mirrors the boxes.

    local file or folder to upload, one of the TEST FILES the server hosts for
    this tool, or a scalar volume already OPEN in the scene (any argument
    `accepts_volume` says yes to).

    Everything sits on ONE line, [sources dropdown][path field + browse], and
    the dropdown is the single place a tool's test data is reached from. There
    used to be two: this list, which sent the hosted NAME and left the file on
    the server, and a separate "Test data" button fetching a hardcoded GitHub
    release URL four modules declared by hand. They answered the same question
    differently, and only one of them put the scan where a clinician could
    open it beside the panel.

    The dropdown's entries, in order: the prompt, the hosted test files (each
    labelled with its kind and size, see `hosted_entry_label`), then the open
    volumes (fed by base_widget; formgen never touches the MRML scene). Which
    kind is selected is decided by INDEX (`_selection`), never by parsing the
    text back, so a hosted file whose name happens to start with the volume
    prefix cannot be misread.

    **Picking a hosted TEST FILE is an action, not a state.** It hands the name
    to the callback base_widget registers (`setHostedCallback`), which
    downloads the file and writes the local path back through `set_local_path`
    - at which point the row holds an ordinary local path like any other, the
    combo returns to its prompt, and the run uploads it. Nothing travels as a
    bare name: the file the user asked to see is on their disk, and a file on
    disk is uploaded.

    Two entries are still a state, for the same reason - there is no local path
    to write. An OPEN VOLUME is exported at upload time
    (base_widget._prepareOneInputFile). A hosted MODEL (`hosted_downloads`
    False, ASO's `reference`) is not downloadable at all - the server declines
    to stream weights, which are selected by name and used in place - so it is
    read back by `server_name()` and sent as a plain form value.

    The sources are kept mutually exclusive by clearing the other one, not by
    letting one silently win: picking a dropdown entry empties the path field,
    and typing/browsing a path resets the dropdown. A precedence rule the user
    cannot see is how you end up uploading a file you thought you had replaced.

    Rebuilding the dropdown (`setChoices`/`setVolumeChoices`) preserves the
    current selection by text when it is still offered: both lists are
    refreshed on every `enter()`, and a refresh must not silently reset a
    chosen entry to the first one in the list.
