        Folded shut, not hidden. "Advanced" is the convention's own name for

        reference volume someone who needs one goes looking for. Open by default
        they sit between the inputs and Apply, so every reader steps over them;
        folded, the ones who want them still find them in one click and nobody
        else meets them at all.

        Done LAST because a ctkCollapsibleButton hides the children it has at
        the moment it is collapsed, and nothing afterwards: a row added to an
        already-folded box is never hidden and draws over the title bar. That is
        what made AutoMatrix's "Reference volume" look crushed into the
        "Advanced" header, and it would have hit every later section the same
        way. configureFields() runs before this, so a module adding its own row
        to one of these sections is folded away with the rest.

        **And done a SECOND time, on the first enter().** Last within the build
        is still not late enough: `_buildForm` assembles the whole panel into a
        detached `QWidget` and only parents it into the module afterwards, so
        this runs on a tree that has never been shown. ctkCollapsibleButton
        folds by hiding its children, and hiding a child of a widget Qt has not
        realised yet does not survive the show that follows -- the box reads as
        folded while its rows are drawn underneath it. Re-folding once the
        module is actually on screen is what makes the state stick.

        Once, not on every enter(): a section the user opened must stay open
        when they leave the module and come back, which is why this is a
        one-shot flag a build sets and the next enter() consumes rather than a
        fold applied every time the panel appears.

        **The fold is forced through a real state change**, and that is the
        whole reason the second attempt works where the first did not.
        `ctkCollapsibleButton::setCollapsed` returns immediately when the value
        it is handed is the one it already holds -- so a box folded during the
        build already believes it is folded, and folding it "again" later runs
        nothing at all: no child pass, no hiding, the rows stay on screen under
        a bar that reads as shut. Stepping through False first is what makes
        CTK run the pass, this time on a widget that has a parent and a screen.
        Both assignments happen inside one turn of the event loop, so nothing
        is painted in between.
