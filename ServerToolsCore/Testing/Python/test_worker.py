"""BackgroundJob: the two timers, and why the second one exists.

A worker thread in Slicer is not a worker thread in a plain interpreter.
Slicer's embedded Python keeps the GIL on the main thread while that thread
waits inside Qt's event loop, so a background download barely progresses:
measured in Slicer, a bytecode loop drops from 13,079,723 iterations per second
to 6,632, and a 94 MB test file that a script fetches in under a second took
twenty seconds from a panel. `BackgroundJob` therefore runs a second timer
whose callback does nothing but `time.sleep`, which releases the GIL.

These tests pin the timer's LIFECYCLE -- started with the job, stopped with it,
never left running -- because a yield timer that outlives its job would keep
the main thread napping for nothing, and one that never starts silently
restores the twenty seconds.
