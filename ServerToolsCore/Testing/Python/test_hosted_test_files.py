"""What happens when a user picks one of a tool's server-hosted test files.

    python3 -m unittest test_hosted_test_files

This is the base_widget half of the mechanism that replaced two contradicting
ones. A tool's test data used to be reachable two ways: the input row's
dropdown, which sent the hosted NAME and left the file on the server, and a
separate "Test data" button four modules declared by hand with a hardcoded
GitHub release URL. Only one of them put the scan where a clinician could open
it beside the panel, and neither knew about the other.

There is one now, it downloads, and the properties that make it usable are all
here: it never blocks the Slicer window, it fetches a given file once per
session, a hosted folder arrives as a .zip and is unpacked, a single file is
shown in the scene and a cohort deliberately is not, and a file the scene
refuses is still a perfectly good input.

`qt`/`ctk`/`slicer` are the stand-ins in qt_stubs.py, plus the few `slicer.util`
functions this path touches. `BackgroundJob` is replaced by a stand-in that
runs the task on a REAL worker thread and delivers it when the test says so -
the point being to prove the work leaves the main thread, which a synchronous
fake could not.
